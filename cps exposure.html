    <p><h1>The amendments that Child Protective Services violates</h1></p> 
    <p><h2>Amendment #4</h2>The right of the people to be secure in their own <i>persons, houses, papers</i>,and <i>effects, </i>against unreasonable
     searches, and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but on probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation
    , and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
    <p>But CPS sometimes searches homes without a warrant as you can see from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJft9OHHCRs">video</a></p>
    <p><h2>The third ammendment</h2> "No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war,
       but in a manner to be prescribed by law."
      As you can see in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJft9OHHCRs">video</a> this is not respected, 
      as you can see by the police trying to come into his home without a warrant.</p>
      <p><h2>The Fifth Ammendment</h2>Grand Jury Indictment:

        No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger.
        Double Jeopardy:
        
        Nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.
        Self-Incrimination:
        
        Nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
        Due Process:
        
        Nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
        Eminent Domain:
        
        Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.
        </p> <p>Several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=our+child+is+being+taken+away+by+cps">cases</a> 
          have been reported of kids being taken away with seemingly no grounds. Some even against the child's will.</p>
          <p><h1>Ethically Questionable Things</h1></p>
          <p><h2>Racism</h2>There have been cases, in California especially of foster parents facing legal challenges over adopting foster kids because of the kids
          , or kid's Indian heritage. A notable case would be the case of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS_3WIykh0o&t=63s">Lexi</a>who was 1.5% Native
         American. She was carried crying, screaming, and squirming to a Choctaw Indian reservation in Utah. These cases are from a law called 
         <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Additional-Resources/ICWA/ICWA-State-Plan.pdf">The Indian Child Welfare Act</a>(ICWA). <!--for more detail--> 
         Here are the <a href="https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa">main words</a> on the law. 
        The ICWA was a law enstated in 1978 by the California government, to protect the rights of Indian children placed in the foster care system. However it 
      ended up creating legal complications, making it harder to adopt an Indian child if you were not an Indian. Children were also taken away against their 
    will from their foster parents whom they loved(and some foster parents wanted to adopt them but couldn't), and being placed with people
  from an Indian tribe whom they did not even know. As for the case of Lexi, as she was only 1.5% Indian, she probably did not even know who the 
Choctaw Indians were. If you want to help Lexi, and all the other foster children in this cruel system without representation sign this

<p><h1>Ethically Questionable Things</h1><a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/english/ad67.pdf"> The information about the birth mother form</a>
  requires all sorts of unecessary information about the birth mother, such as her age, childhood diseases
, or the age of her father. These things could be used to incriminate her in the future. 
<a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/english/ad67a.pdf">The information about the birth father form</a> is no better.</p>
